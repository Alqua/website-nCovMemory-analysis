This website present some analysis of the nCovMemory project, which was a database of articles related to the coronavirus epidemy in China hosted on a GitHub repo.

This repo has since been deleted by its authors in fear of reprisal by the chinese authorities. However, many forks of the project still exist [online](https://github.com/Alqua/nCovMemory) and a version of the repo is still available on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20200425145421/https:/2019ncovmemory.github.io/nCovMemory/#)

The analysis presented here are computer generated, they complement the master thesis I wrote, in french, on the subject. The thesis is not available on this website but if you are interested, you can contact me through my [GitHub](https://github.com/Alqua).
